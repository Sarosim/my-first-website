# My Very First Webpage

Welcome!

### This is my very first webpage,
Which you can reach here: https://sarosim.github.io/my-first-website/index.html

#### Overview
As part of my learning journey with Code Institute I followed the instructions in the User Centric Frontend Development module, which introduced Cloud9, Git and GitHub.
Using the learnings from the previous modules we created this simple webpage where logos of the technologies ...... xxxxxxxxxxx TO BE CONTINUED
#### What does it do
Clicking o the logos of the various technologies will direct the reader to the corresponding Wikipedia stie to be able to learn about it. There are three pages and a navigation bar on the top of each where we can switch between them.
#### Features
I thought the old-school hyperlinks were not the nicest looking solution so I used transparent pictures for the logos, and made them behave like buttons.
To give it a button feel, I created box shadow and changing color for hovering over the "buttons" with the mouse. A picture says 1000 words, therefore I included a nice picture from Code Institute's webpage.
#### Credits 
The biggest credit goes obviously to the Code Institute, but right after that also to Wikipedia, no need to explain why...
#### Technologies used
HTML to create the pagesand, <br/>
CSS to give it a nice(er) look,<br/>
Cloud9 <br/>
Git for controlling versions and <br/>
GitHub for storing and hosting it<br/>
