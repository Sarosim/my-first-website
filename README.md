# My Very First Webpage

Welcome!

### This is my very first webpage,
Which you can reach here: https://sarosim.github.io/my-first-website/index.html

#### Overview
As part of my learning journey with Code Institute I followed the instructions in the User Centric Frontend Development module, which introduced Cloud9, Git and GitHub.
Using the learnings from the previous modules we created this simple webpage where images of the technologies are displayed and clicking on them brings up the corresponding Wkikipedia article. 
#### What does it do
Clicking o the logos of the various technologies will direct the reader to the corresponding Wikipedia stie to be able to learn about them. There are three pages and a navigation bar on the top of each where we can switch between them.
#### Features
I thought the old-school hyperlinks were not the nicest looking solution therefore I used transparent pictures for the logos, hid the hyperlinks themselves and made the logos behave like buttons.
To give it a button feel, I rounded the corners, created box shadow and changing color for hovering over the "buttons" with the mouse.<br/><br/> A picture says 1000 words, therefore I included a nice picture from Code Institute's webpage just under the navigation bar, displaying the 'page title' in it.
#### Credits 
The biggest credit goes obviously to the Code Institute, but right after that also to Wikipedia, no need to explain why...
#### Technologies used:
- HTML to create the pages <br/>
- CSS to give it a nice(er) look,<br/>
+ Cloud9 dasboard and workspaces to organize and manage the files <br/>
* Git for controlling versions and <br/>
* GitHub for storing and hosting the project<br/>
